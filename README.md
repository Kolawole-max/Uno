# Uno

Uno is a Universal Personal Data Management System that aims to streamline the process of filling out forms on multiple company websites. The system uses **OpenCV** facial recognition technology for live verification of users

## Problem discovered 

The current process of filling out forms on multiple company websites can be strenuous and time-consuming for users. Additionally, companies may face challenges in verifying the true identity of users who submit personal information through their forms. 

## Proposed solution

Uno proposes a solution to these challenges by using facial recognition technology to verify users' identities in real time. The system can collect personal information from users, including photo identification cards, which are used to verify the true identity of users by extracting user photos from their identity cards and comparing them to their live facial images.
